Matched betting is possibly one of the easiest and most lucrative ways of making money online.

The process is completely legal and, if executed properly, completely risk-free. As someone who is almost totally risk-averse, this is what makes matched betting so attractive.

I've been doing matched betting for the past couple of months and have effortlessly been able to make around £500, without ever losing any money doing so.

## How it works

Matched betting, put simply, is a technique to profit from the free bets and incentives offered by bookmakers.

It is a tried-and-tested technique that is totally risk free when done correctly. This is due to the fact that it relies on mathematical equations rather than chance.

There are two types of bets that allow matched betting to work:

1. 'Back' bet
2. 'Lay' bet

A **back** bet is what you might think of as a typical bet. You are betting _for_ a certain outcome, e.g. "I bet Real Madrid will win". If it comes true, you take your winnings. Otherwise, if they lose or draw, you lose your stake.

A **lay** bet is instead where you bet _against_ a certain outcome, e.g. "I bet Real Madrid won't win". This time, if they lose or draw, you win the bet. However, if they win, you will lose your stake. This type of bet can only be placed on a betting exchange like Betfair, and not with a standard bookmaker like Coral or Ladbrokes.

Matched betting works by cancelling out the risk of our **back** bet by betting against ourselves at the same odds using a **lay** bet — in other words, we match our bet.

Following our first or 'qualifying' bet, you will then be awarded the free bet by the bookmaker. **This is where the magic happens.** We simply repeat the process: bet using the free bet, and then lay the bet. Whatever the result, you are guaranteed to make a profit!

The odds are typically found by 'auto-matching' software, which finds the closest betting odds on a given bookmaker and exchange.

For the qualifying bet, the odds should be as low as possible without being below the minimum odds requirement. For the free bet, the odds should instead be as high as possible to maximise profit.

## Profiting

For each matched bet you complete, you could be left with up to 95% of the free bet value as profit.

Losses typically result from any betting exchange commission (usually 5%), as well as from minor odds differences between the bookmaker and the betting exchange. This is what prevents us from achieving 100% of the free bet as profit.

This is a very small loss and, is totally outweighed by the profit gained after completing the free bet.

## The risk

Matched betting is really a simple process once you've wrapped your head around it, and anybody can learn to do it.

In theory, the process is totally risk free as we are covered for any eventuality, ensuring a profit is achieved.

As such, the risk only comes about when mistakes are made, or T&Cs are not read properly. Therefore, you should always double-check everything and follow the steps of a reputable guide precisely.

## In practice

There are plenty of guides out there which give detailed walk-throughs of actual matched betting examples. I highly recommend [this](https://www.savethestudent.org/make-money/what-is-matched-betting.html) guide.

Once you feel comfortable with the process, and have completed free bets suggested by guides, you can have a search around for more bookmakers offering free bets to maximise your profit.

For some of these bookmakers, you may need to use [this](https://bonusbagging.co.uk/oddsmatching.php) auto-matcher if one is not provided in a guide.

## Conclusion

The fact remains that matched betting is a super easy way of making some decent cash online, totally legally and risk-free.

The process is fairly easy to learn, and can be applied to many offer types, including slight variations of the methods described here like risk-free betting offers.

It is important to understand the entire process clearly, read T&Cs specifics, and ensure that everything is executed correctly in order to avoid any mistakes.

You should also follow any betting or gambling requirements in your country, and check that matched betting does not violate any T&Cs you agree to.
