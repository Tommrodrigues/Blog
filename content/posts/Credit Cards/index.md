When used properly, credit cards are an excellent way to get the most out of your spending.

Credit card issuers incentivise spending by providing welcome offers, spending bonuses, and other exclusive benefits.

You just do your everyday spending on them and, in return, you receive cashback or points.

You can put this cash towards future purchases, and turn points into vouchers for shops, airlines, and more.

## Welcome offers

First are welcome offers - one of the easiest ways to benefit from a credit card.

Most card companies will entice you with something like "spend £3,000 in your first three months and earn 20,000 points".

Essentially, if you spend a certain amount of money on the card in the first few months of owning it, you get a fantastic one-time reward.

Depending on your card type, this could be in the form of hard cash, or points you can redeem for vouchers, discounts, and other benefits.

These offers are especially great if you have a big purchase coming up, e.g. a new computer, and would've spent that money anyway.

## Spending bonuses

Next are spending bonuses, which are the best way to benefit from a rewards credit card on a day-to-day basis.

Basically, for every £1 you spend, you are rewarded some of that back either as cashback, or as points.

For example, you might get 5% cashback or 3 points per full pound spent using your credit card.

These spending bonuses can really add up, saving you hundreds every year, or giving you enough points you can redeem for holiday flights.

## Exclusive benefits

Some cards, especially those that charge an annual membership fee, offer some truly exclusive benefits in addition to the perks already listed.

These benefits range from premium airport lounge access and free hotel upgrades, all the way to a private concierge service and access to exclusive, invite-only events.

For most people, these benefits aren't worth the high annual fee, but for some, the extra luxury, exclusivity, and prestige is worth the price.

## Other benefits

The benefits don't stop there either.

Often, you will receive exclusive offers for retailers, e.g. "Spend £500 with British Airways and get £150 back". Plenty of these deals are made available every week, and it's a great way to save some extra money.

Additionally, many credit card issuers offer some form of insurance for simply owning the card. This can include travel insurance, life insurance, medical insurance, legal assistance, possessions insurance, car rental insurance, and personal accident insurance.

Further, all UK credit cards offer purchase protection. This means that, for eligible purchases, the credit card issuer is equally as liable to provide a refund as the seller if there is an issue. As an example, this might be really helpful if your holiday gets cancelled and the hotel won't refund you.

Finally, remember that paying off your bill in full every month strengthens your credit score, proving your ability to pay off debts. This can be especially useful when it comes to getting a mortgage or a loan, and may even reduce interest rates.

## Need-to-knows

This all sounds great, but if you don't pay off your balance in full every month, you will get hit with interest on the money you owe, outweighing all of these benefits.

The best way to avoid this is to set up a direct debit that pays your bill **in full** every month.

You should also make sure you only use the card for **normal** spending, and don't use your credit as an excuse to overspend.

It is also important to **never** withdraw cash on the card as this is will attract hefty fees and interest rates, even if you pay the card off in full.

Finally, if you have debts, it's best to sort them out before going for a rewards card.

## Conclusion

When used properly, a credit card will only benefit you, and you'll be able to take advantage of the amazing offers available.

Always shop around to find the best deal, and see how you can maximise any offerings.

Think about what you want from a rewards card - if you shop at a certain supermarket, maybe it's best to get points you can redeem there. Or, if you fly a lot, an airline credit card might benefit you the most.
